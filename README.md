# Expense-Tracker
 I developed an Expense Tracker application to help users manage their finances efficiently. Built using Java and Spring Boot, it allows users to track income, expenses, and savings in real-time. The app features a clean, intuitive interface powered by CSS for styling and MySQL for secure data storage.
